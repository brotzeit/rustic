#+TITLE: Readme
The way I develop the filter is:
1. Select an html-file to focus on, such as [[./debug_files/enum.Option.html]].
2. Open [[./filter.lua]].
3. Open [[./debug_files/option.org]].
4. Open [[./debug_files/filterednative]].
5. Running `make` will now update =option.org= with the org-representation and =filterednative= with the pandoc representation. If anything looks weird in the org-version, more details can be found in filterednative.
   6. See [[./Makefile]] for the alternatives. =make standard= uses the default, whereas =make primitive= uses HTML for the type =i16=, which is formatted differently since it is a primitive.
