## Intro

This package is based on [rust-mode](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-mode) and provides additional features:

- flycheck integration
- cargo popup
- multiline error parsing
- translation of ANSI control sequences through
  [xterm-color](https://github.com/atomontage/xterm-color)
- async org babel
- custom compilation process
- rustfmt errors in a rust compilation mode
- automatic LSP configuration with
  [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) or
  [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode)
- Optional rust inline documentation
- cask for testing
- requires emacs 26
- etc.

rustic only shares the rust-mode code from rust-mode.el and rust-utils.el.
The other files provide functionality that is similar to some of the features
of rustic, however can be considered light-weight compared to some rustic's
functionality.

The shared functions and options exist as aliases in the rust-mode and
rustic namespace for backwards compatability reasons(rustic has been a fork).

## Known issues

- `rustic-format-buffer` occasionally sets point to beginning of buffer,
   use `rustic-format-file` instead
- `rust-syntax-propertize` and `adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode` can lead to
  severe lag when editing larger files (#107)

## Installation

Simply put `(use-package rustic)` in your config and most stuff gets
configured automatically.
([use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package))

It's necessary to include elpa for a package dependency:

```elisp
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
```

If ‘spinner-1.7.3’ is unavailable” when trying to install rustic, you
need to update GPG keys used by the ELPA package manager. Try
installing
[gnu-elpa-keyring-update](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnu-elpa-keyring-update.html).

If you have `rust-mode` installed, ensure it is required before rustic
since it has to be removed from `auto-mode-alist`. However you only
need `rust-mode` if you want to use `emacs-racer`. There's some stuff
that isn't included in rustic.

If you have any issues with rustic, please try running emacs without
`rust-mode` loaded.

If you can't run rust-analyzer or cargo can't be found, your
environment variables probably don't work in emacs.  Try
[exec-path-from-shell](https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell/tree/81125c5adbc903943c016c2984906dc089372a41#usage)
to fix this.

### straight

[straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#install-packages)
clones each of your packages directly from its source. There are good
additional [installation
instructions](https://github.crookster.org/switching-to-straight.el-from-emacs-26-builtin-package.el/)
for moving your package management from package.el to straight.

## Compilation

Rustic defines a derived compilation-mode. Colors can be customized
with several defcustoms.  You can use `next-error` and
`compilation-next-error` as for any other compilation buffer.

However it's possible to also jump to line numbers that are displayed
at the beginning of a line.  This feature is provided by a hook around
`compile-goto-error`(`RET`).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/compilation_buffer.png)

Commands:

- `rustic-compile`            compile project using `rustic-compile-command`
- `rustic-recompile`          recompile using `compilation-arguments`
- `rustic-compile-send-input` send string to process of current buffer

Customization:

- `rustic-compile-display-method` choose function that displays the
  compilation buffer (use the function `ignore`, if you don't want the
  buffer to be displayed)
- `rustic-compile-backtrace` change backtrace verbosity
- `rustic-compile-command` default command for rust compilation

Supported compile.el variables:

- compilation-arguments
- compilation-scroll-output

### default directory

`rustic-compile-directory-method` allows you to set the directory that
is used for compilation commands. The default is the current crate
which is returned by `rustic-buffer-crate`(there's also
`rustic-buffer-workspace`).

If you want to use the project root you can use `rustic-project-root`
instead.

FTR #174 #179 #236

### Faces

The colors that are displayed in compilation buffers come from cargo
and are translated by xterm-color. You can change these colors by
modifying `rustic-ansi-faces`.

`rustic-compilation-mode` doesn't use the default faces of
compile.el. If you want to change these colors you can use something
similar to:

```elisp
(custom-set-faces
  '(rustic-compilation-column ((t (:inherit compilation-column-number))))
  '(rustic-compilation-line ((t (:foreground "LimeGreen")))))
```

Additional faces:

- `rustic-message`
- `rustic-compilation-error`
- `rustic-compilation-warning`
- `rustic-compilation-info`

### rustc errors

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/rustc_errno.png)

## Rustfmt

You can format your code with:

- `rustic-format-buffer` format buffer with stdin
- `rustic-format-file`   format file and revert buffer
- `rustic-cargo-fmt`     run cargo-fmt on workspace
- `rustic-format-region` format active region

Rustic uses the function `rustic-save-some-buffers` for saving buffers
before compilation. To save buffers automatically, you can change the
value of `buffer-save-without-query`. In case you prefer using lsp for
formatting, turn off `rustic-format-on-save` and set
`rustic-lsp-format`to `t`.

Customization:

- `rustic-rustfmt-bin` path to rustfmt executable
- `rustic-rustfmt-args` additional args like +nightly
- `rustic-rustfmt-config-alist` alist of rustfmt configuration options
- `rustic-format-display-method` default function used for displaying
  rustfmt buffer (use the function `ignore`, if you don't want the
  buffer to be displayed)
- `rustic-format-on-save-method` function to use for on-save formatting
- `rustic-format-trigger`
  * `'on-save` format buffer before saving
  * `'on-compile` run 'cargo fmt' before compilation
  * `nil` don't format automatically


known issues:

in case you are using hideshow you might want to set `rustic-format-on-save-method` to `rustic-format-buffer`(#274)

### Change default arguments

If you want to configure the following rustfmt call

```shell
rustfmt +nightly --config hard_tabs=true --config skip_children=false main.rs
```

you can use

```elisp
(setq rustic-rustfmt-args "+nightly")
(setq rustic-rustfmt-config-alist '((hard_tabs . t) (skip_children . nil)))
```

### edition 2018

If you are struggling with errors relating to the rust edition in
`cargo.toml`, this may in fact be a problem with `rustfmt` and its
default settings. To solve this, *even though the error message
mentions `cargo.toml`*, you you have to put `edition = "2018"` in a
`rustfmt.toml`. [See here for more
info](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/4454).

## LSP

Disable LSP support by setting `rustic-lsp-client` to nil. You have to
restart emacs when you switch lsp clients.

### Server

rust-analyzer is the default and can be changed to rls. lsp-mode
related code was moved to the lsp-mode repo.  `rustic-lsp-server` sets
the value of `lsp-rust-server`.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq rustic-lsp-server 'rls)
```

Change rust-analyzer path.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq rustic-analyzer-command '("~/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer"))
```

### Client

The default package is `lsp-mode`. But you can also use `eglot`.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq rustic-lsp-client 'eglot)
```

LSP commands:

`xref-find-definitions`

`xref-find-references` with helm and rust-analyzer

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/xref_references.png)

#### eglot

Turn off flymake.

``` emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eglot--managed-mode-hook (lambda () (flymake-mode -1)))
```

#### lsp-mode

- `lsp-describe-thing-at-point` display documentation
- `lsp-find-definition` makes use of xref

You can find more information in the [lsp-mode
wiki](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-rust/).

##### `lsp-execute-code-action`

This command can be extremely convenient when applying code actions or
using auto-imports.

Run `lsp-execute-code-action` when lsp-ui displays code actions at the
top of the sideline.

###### Applying code actions

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/code_actions.png)

###### Auto import

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/auto_import.png)

##### Macro expansion

`lsp-rust-analyzer-expand-macro` expand macro call at point
recursively

The results are formatted and highlighted by default, but you can use
your own function by customizing
`lsp-rust-analyzer-macro-expansion-method`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/macro_expansion.png)

### LSP + TRAMP

`rust-analyzer` does work over TRAMP, but you have to register the client
manually:

``` elisp
(with-eval-after-load "lsp-rust"
 (lsp-register-client
  (make-lsp-client
   :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection
                    (lambda ()
                      `(,(or (executable-find
                              (cl-first lsp-rust-analyzer-server-command))
                             (lsp-package-path 'rust-analyzer)
                             "rust-analyzer")
                        ,@(cl-rest lsp-rust-analyzer-server-args))))
   :remote? t
   :major-modes '(rust-mode rustic-mode)
   :initialization-options 'lsp-rust-analyzer--make-init-options
   :notification-handlers (ht<-alist lsp-rust-notification-handlers)
   :action-handlers (ht ("rust-analyzer.runSingle" #'lsp-rust--analyzer-run-single))
   :library-folders-fn (lambda (_workspace) lsp-rust-library-directories)
   :after-open-fn (lambda ()
                    (when lsp-rust-analyzer-server-display-inlay-hints
                      (lsp-rust-analyzer-inlay-hints-mode)))
   :ignore-messages nil
   :server-id 'rust-analyzer-remote)))
```

*(based on https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/68fddd5d9c5506b2adf6a3f67bbe568f44563dd4/clients/lsp-rust.el#L644)*

If you have Emacs 28, due to some [compatibility issues](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/2514#issuecomment-759452037),
you might have to additionally use:

``` elisp
(defun start-file-process-shell-command@around (start-file-process-shell-command name buffer &rest args)
  "Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it. Similar to `start-process-shell-command', but calls `start-file-process'."
  ;; On remote hosts, the local `shell-file-name' might be useless.
  (let ((command (mapconcat 'identity args " ")))
    (funcall start-file-process-shell-command name buffer command)))

(advice-add 'start-file-process-shell-command :around #'start-file-process-shell-command@around)
```

*(thanks to https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/2514#issuecomment-759452037)*

You'll have to have `rust-analyzer` already installed on the target machine.

## Cargo

### Edit

[cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) provides commands to edit
your dependencies quickly.

The rustic commands can be called with prefix `C-u` if you want to
modify the parameters of a command.

- `rustic-cargo-add`      Add crate to Cargo.toml using 'cargo add'
- `rustic-cargo-rm`       Remove crate from Cargo.toml using 'cargo rm'
- `rustic-cargo-upgrade`  Upgrade dependencies as specified in the local manifest file using 'cargo upgrade'

### Test

`rustic-cargo-test` run 'cargo test', when called with `C-u` store
arguments in `rustic-test-arguments`

`rustic-cargo-test-rerun` rerun 'cargo test' with arguments stored in
`rustic-test-arguments`

`rustic-cargo-current-test` run test at point, whether it's a function or a module

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/cargo_current_test.png)

### Run

`rustic-cargo-run` run 'cargo run'.  Input can be sent to the program
in one of two ways:

- `rustic-compile-send-input`, which reads the input from the
  minibuffer.
- `rustic-cargo-run-use-comint`: when this variable is set to t, the
  input can be typed directly into the output buffer of 'cargo run'
  and sent off with `RET`, just like in `comint-mode`.  You need
  [polymode](https://polymode.github.io) installed for this to work.

### Outdated

Use `rustic-cargo-outdated` to get a list of dependencies that are out
of date. The results are displayed in `tabulated-list-mode` and you
can use most commands you know from the emacs package menu. This
option requires the rust package `cargo-outdated` to be installed
before being used.

- `u` mark single crate for upgrade
- `U` mark all upgradable crates
- `m` remove mark
- `x` perform marked package menu actions
- `r` refresh crate list
- `q` quit window

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/outdated.png)

### More cargo commands

- `rustic-cargo-init` run 'cargo init' to initialize a directory
- `rustic-cargo-new` use 'cargo new' to create a new package
- `rustic-cargo-bench` run 'cargo bench' for the current project
- `rustic-cargo-build-doc` build the documentation for the current project
- `rustic-cargo-doc` open the documentation for the current project in a browser

## Clippy

Currently cargo does not display the correct installation command for
some toolchains when clippy isn't installed.  If you have problems try
it with `rustup component add --toolchain nightly clippy`.

### Commands

- `rustic-cargo-clippy`     to view the results in a derived compilation mode
- `rustic-cargo-clippy-fix` run 'clippy fix' using `rustic-cargo-clippy-fix-args`
                            the default value is "--allow-dirty"

### Flycheck

In case you want to see clippy lints with flycheck, you can activate
this checker and use the command `flycheck-list-errors`

```elisp
(push 'rustic-clippy flycheck-checkers)
```

Turn off flycheck.

```elisp
(remove-hook 'rustic-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)
```

The parameters of the checker can be modified with `rustic-flycheck-clippy-params`
and are by default configured for using unstable options that are only available
on the nightly toolchains.

If you are using the stable toolchain you have to change the value:

```elisp
(setq rustic-flycheck-clippy-params "--message-format=json")
```

### lsp-mode

If you are using `lsp-mode` with rust-analyzer, you can set
`lsp-rust-analyzer-cargo-watch-command` to clippy instead of
activating the checker `rustic-clippy`.

## Org-babel

### Intro

Blocks run asynchronously and a running babel process is indicated by
a spinner in the mode-line. It's possible to use crates in babel
blocks. Execute babel block with `org-babel-execute-src-block`.

Supported org babel parameters:

Write to file `:results file :file ~/babel-output`

Customization:

- `rustic-babel-format-src-block` format block after successful build
- `rustic-babel-display-compilation-buffer` display compilation buffer
  of babel process
- `rustic-babel-auto-wrap-main` wrap body into main function

### Commands

- `rustic-babel-format-block` format block at point
- `rustic-babel-visit-project` find generated project of block at point

### Parameters

#### :crates

```
#+BEGIN_SRC rust :crates '((regex . "*"))
  extern crate regex;

  use regex::Regex;

  fn main() {
      let re = Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap();
      assert!(re.is_match("2014-01-01"));
  }
#+END_SRC
```

#### :features

If specific crate features are required then these can be specified
with the `:features` argument. Note that if it is just a single feature
then a string, instead of a list, will also be accepted:

```
#+BEGIN_SRC rust :crates '((tokio . 1.0)) :features '((tokio . ("rt-multi-thread" "time")))
  extern crate tokio;

  fn main() {
      tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()
          .unwrap()
          .block_on(async {
              tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(10)).await;
          });
  }
#+END_SRC
```

#### :paths

Similarly, to depend on local Rust crates, you can set the `:paths`
argument:

```
#+BEGIN_SRC rust :crates '((foo . 1.0)) :paths '((foo . "/home/you/code/foo"))
  use foo::Foo;

  fn main() {
    // Your code.
  }
#+END_SRC
```

#### :toolchain

You can also specify the `:toolchain`. Remember to quote the value!

```
#+begin_src rust :toolchain 'nightly
fn main() {
    let foo: String = vec!["a", "b", "c"].into_iter().intersperse(",").collect();

    println!("{}", foo);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: a,b,c
```

#### :main

Auto wrap whole block body in a `fn main` function call if none
exists.

Since this is very handy in most code snippets, so the default value
is `yes`.  `no` if you don't want this feature(for example, you don't
want regex search slow things down).

You can also set a default value by:
``` elisp
;; By setq this default to `nil`, you'll have to explict set params to ":main yes" in each block
(setq rustic-babel-auto-wrap-main nil)
```

```
#+begin_src rust :main yes
let x = vec![1, 2, 3].iter().map(|&x| x + 1).collect::<Vec<_>>();
println!("{:?}", x);
#+end_src

#+results:
: [2, 3, 4]
```

#### :include

This parameter allows you to run code that is located in different
babel blocks by using named blocks with the `:include` keyword. This
feature only concats the blocks so you don't need to import the code
you want to use.

You can still use `:main` to wrap the code of the main block.

```
#+name: b1
#+begin_src rust
pub fn b1_func() -> String {
    String::from("b1 function called")
}
#+end_src

#+name: b2
#+begin_src rust
pub fn b2_func() -> String {
    String::from("b2 function called")
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src rust :include '("b1" "b2")
  fn main() {
      println!("{:?}", b1_func());
      println!("{:?}", b2_func());
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "b1 function called"
: "b2 function called"
```

#### :use

When using this keyword blocks are treated as modules. The files are
generated automatically.

```
#+name: mymodule
#+begin_src rust
pub fn myfunc() -> String {
    String::from("mymodule function called")
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src rust :use '("mymodule")
use mymodule::myfunc;

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", myfunc());
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "mymodule function called"
```

## Spinner

In case you want to use a different spinner type you can modify
`rustic-spinner-type` or turn it off completely with
`rustic-display-spinner`.([Available spinner
types](https://github.com/Malabarba/spinner.el/blob/master/spinner.el#L104)).

## inline-documentation

It is possible to read rust documentation inside
Emacs! This currently requires LSP-mode and cargo.  ![Rustic-doc
example](img/rustic-doc.png)

### Prequisites

* Install Pandoc, preferably at least version 2.11, as it will give somewhat nicer generated documentation: https://pandoc.org/installing.html
* Install cargo
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html
* Install helm-ag https://github.com/emacsorphanage/helm-ag (Optional,
  but highly recommended)
* If you do not have them, you will be prompted to install `fd-find`,
  `ripgrep` and `cargo-makedocs` when you run `rustic-doc-setup`.
    * `ripgrep` is optional but highly recommended.
    * If helm-ag and ripgrep is installed, those will be used by
      default.
    * If only ripgrep is installed, it will be used with the emacs
      `grep` command.
    * If neither is installed, the emacs `grep` command will use
      `grep`, like in the good old days.
    * You can change this by providing your own search function by
      changing `rustic-doc-search-function`.

### Usage

* Enable `rustic-doc-mode`.
* Run `M-x rustic-doc-setup` to download files that rustic-doc needs
  to convert rust documentation and also convert `std`.
* You can now convert package-specific documentation with `M-x
  rustic-doc-convert-current-package`
* Search the org files with `rustic-doc-search` (bound to `C-#` by
  default) if you are in `Rust mode`, `Rustic mode` or `Org mode`. If
  you hover over a symbol when you invoke the command,
  `rustic-doc-search` will insert a default value.
* Add `universal argument` to only search for level 1 headers like
  struct or enum names.

### Notes

* You should re-run `rustic-doc-setup` once in a while, to update the
  pandoc filter.
* If rustic-doc does not find the documentation for something, the
  first thing to do is check the project's `target/doc` folder for the
  corresponding `.html-file`. If there is no file there, there is
  nothing for rustic-doc to convert. If there is a file there, please
  create an issue!

## Popup

You can execute commands with `rustic-popup`. The list of commands can
be customized with `rustic-popup-commands`.  The command
`rustic-popup-default-action` (`RET` or `TAB`) allows you to change:

- `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable
- `compilation-arguments` for `recompile`
- arguments for `cargo test`

If you want to close the popup after you ran a command you can set
`rustic-kill-buffer-and-window` to `t`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/popup.png)

View help buffer containing a command's flags with `h`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brotzeit/rustic/master/img/popup_help.png)

## rust-mode

The rustic mode derives from rust-mode using all of its functionality. However
we replace default key bindings and some hooks.

There are also some additional commands:

- `rust-dbg-wrap-or-unwrap` Either remove or add the dbg! macro
- `rust-toggle-mutability` Toggles the mutability of the variable defined on the current line
- `rust-promote-module-into-dir` Promote the module file visited by the current buffer into its own directory

## elisp tests

To run the tests, you will need [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask).

``` bash
