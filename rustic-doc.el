;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets you convert rustic-doc html-files to org mode
;; files, and lets you browse them with `rustic-doc-search'.

;; Run `M-x rustic-doc-setup' to download the required files and
;;   convert the rust standard library.

;; Run `M-x rustic-doc-convert-current-package' to generate and
;; convert docs for the package you are currently visiting.
